To run, run the following command:
py wheelOfTimeDatabase.py *jsonName* *databaseName*

Notes:
Note that the json file must end in .json and the sqlite file must end in .sqlite.
Please insert the filepath to the json if it is not in the same file as the program
For convenience, wheel_of_time.json has been included in the folder.
Additionally, note that the sqlite file does not need to exist, but if there is a specific
location that it must be created, please include the filepath.
